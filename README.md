Krystal PHP Framework
=====================

Yet another PHP framework with focus on testability and decent code-base. It follows SOLID, SoC and known best practises in general.

Usage
=====

You can simply download and extract the archive into the root of your server. Composer-based installation will be added soon. 
As for API usage, you can refer to the documentation.

I was trying to build a framework to be as simple as possible. In fact, you don't need to configure almost anything! Even `.htaccess` with Apache. 
To start building a modular application, you would simply add routes and respond to their matches in controllers.

Installation
============

Krystal Framework requires no any special installation steps. Just download it, extract it to your web-root folder. Then just open it.


System requirements
===================

Krystal Framework requires PHP 5.3.0 or greater. Use latest PHP version whenever possible.
