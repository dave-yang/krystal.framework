=====================

Yet another PHP framework with focus on testability and decent code-base. It follows SOLID, SoC and known best practises in general.

Usage
=====

You can simply download and extract the archive into the root of your server. Composer-based installation will be added soon. 
As for API usage, you can refer to the documentation
