Tree component
==============

Tree component simplifies work with trees, by abstracting common tasks, such as processing the raw array (That might come from a table) into a tree and rendering it.
This implementation is not coupled to any storage engine (such as MySQL, or XML document), and can be used independently.



Planned in next versions:

 - Add closure table support
 - Add nested set model support
