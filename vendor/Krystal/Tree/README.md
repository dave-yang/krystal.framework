Tree component
==============

Tree component simplifies work with trees, by abstracting common tasks, such as processing the raw array (That might come from a table) into a tree and rendering it.
This implementation is not coupled to any storage engine (such as MySQL, or XML document), and can be used independently.

It allows you to easily represents trees in different formats, such as recursive `ul -> li` list and list. You can surely write your own if needed.
