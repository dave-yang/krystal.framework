Text component=============This component has several tools to work with text.# Slug generator    \Krystal\Text\SlugGeneratorIt can be used to generate URL slugs. It has only one method called `generate()`. Let's start from a basic example:    use Krystal\Text\SlugGenerator;        $string = 'Hello World!';        $sg = new SlugGenerator();    echo $sg->generate($string); // hello-worldIf you work with strings that aren't English and want not to romanize them, you can pass `false` to the constructor.# Text trimmer    \Krystal\Text\TextTrimmerYou probably have already seen how blogging sites trim article contents on their sites. This class is meant to do the trimming, Let's start from a basic example:    <?php        use Krystal\Text\TextTrimmer;        $content = '..Here is a string with a very long content..';    $length = 20; // Maximal length        $tt = TextTrimmer();    echo $tt->trim($content, $length);This will trim that long string, appending `...` at the end. If you want to change a text which is appended by default, you can pass an optional argument to the constructor, which is an override.
