# Grid component

A powerful, lightweight and flexible data grid component that can generate tables. Just provide a data (typically that you received from a database) and define how you want to output data (whether a column should be inline-editable or contain a filter, and so on). By default it styles output using Bootstrap 3 corresponding CSS-classes, but you can easily override these ones if needed. 

## Features

 - Inline-edit support
 - Filtering (supports input and select elements)
 - Sorting
 - Batch removal
 - Custom action buttons
 - Custom data output format
